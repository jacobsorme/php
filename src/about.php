Game registered in Cocos Islands, developed in Sweden. "Founded" in 2015. Planned "release" is Aug 28 2017. The online part of the game is written in PHP - data is written to text files. I have very little knowledge of "real" databases like SQL and what not. The graphics is rendered using a canvas. In the beginning the game was "rendered" using html tags - like div's and svg's.
